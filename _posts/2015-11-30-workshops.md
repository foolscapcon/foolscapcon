### 11 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. (Track 1: Fiction)
####Writing in (and about) a Diverse World
Participants should come prepared to write. We'll use our own experiences combined with prompts to portray genuine characters who are different from ourselves. We'll also acquire tools for both creating and critically examining the rich wealth of representation that can make our fiction feel true.

###11 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. (Track 2: Screenwriting)
####Introduction to Screenwriting
Is your dream to become a screenwriter? Do you brainstorm script ideas or start writing but do not know what to do next? This class is the perfect introduction to the fantastic world of writing a screenplay.  Designed for passionate screenwriters of every skill level and interest, this class gets your screenplay on track for success.

###1:30 - 3 p.m.
####Level Up as a Writer
This "kitchen sink" presentation will cover everything from beginning writer mistakes to advanced plotting techniques, and the common evolutionary stages many writers go through from aspiring writer to published pro. Whatever stage you are at, you will hopefully learn something to help you level up as a writer. With handouts! And exercises! But not the sweaty kind of exercises.
