Foolscap strives to be a safe and welcoming place where everyone is respected, comfortable, and can be themselves. All members of the convention are expected to treat other members, hotel staff, and the general public with respect. For that reason, physical and verbal harassment will not be tolerated.

If a person tells you “no,” your business with them is done. If you continue to attempt to have contact with that person, you may be removed from the premises for the remainder of the event.

The following will be considered harassment: physical or verbal threats; unwelcome attention; stalking; pushing, shoving, or use of physical force; behavior that creates a disturbance or is dangerous, including lewd or generally offensive behavior or language; using sexually explicit or offensive language or conduct; excessive profanity; obscene gestures; use of racial, religious, sexual, gender, ability, or ethnic slurs.

We recognize that some panels may involve discussion of sexual or otherwise potentially offensive content. Foolscap's policy is to obtain advance consent from everyone present before discussing otherwise prohibited topics, and to remember that consent can always be withdrawn by anyone. If you become uncomfortable during a discussion, you have the right to ask that the topic be changed. Because we know it can feel disruptive to ask people to change the topic, we have a no-questions-asked policy - you are never expected to provide a reason why you do not wish to discuss a topic.

Remember:  

* “No” means no.
* “Stop” means stop.
* “Go away” means go away.
* Attire is not consent.

### Reporting Harassment or Conduct Violations

We have taken steps to make it easier to report instances of offensive and/or harassing behavior. If you are being harassed or are in any way endangered, we hope you will report it, as we cannot address anything that we are not made aware of. Whatever detail can be provided, such as names, badge numbers, or other descriptive information, will help us respond.

If you experience or witness harassment or threatening behavior, or have concerns about anyone's safety please find the nearest Listener. Listeners can be identified by their bright purple sashes. You can also go to the registration desk in the Commons and ask for a Listener. When you report something to a Listener, it becomes their job to be your advocate. They will listen to you, believe you, and help you understand your options.

If, at any time, you feel that your personal safety or the safety of others is in jeopardy, please contact hotel security or the local police department in an emergency via 911.

As a member, if you witness harassment, threatening behavior, or other inappropriate conduct, we encourage you to speak up and say something. We want to come together as a community, look out for one another, and ensure everyone is treated with respect.

### Consequences of Code of Conduct Violation

Foolscap reserves the right to revoke convention membership and attendance at events. If Foolscap judges an individual to be in violation of the Code of Conduct during an event, they may be barred from the event for an explicit amount of time or the duration of the event. If we are concerned that an individual is breaking the law – city, state or federal – we may involve police.
