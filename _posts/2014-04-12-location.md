Foolscap is headed to a new home!

Foolscap 2016 will be at the [Hilton Seattle Airport](http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/washington/hilton-seattle-airport-and-conference-center-SEAAHHH/index.html), right across the street from SeaTac Airport. 

Our new location is easy to reach by highway with plenty of on-site parking, and is across the street from the airport light rail station. Trains run to downtown Seattle until just after midnight, so you can stay late and still get home - or stay on-site so you can talk and game into the wee hours. Rooms start at $114 a night, and some larger rooms are available for special events.

[Book your room online](http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/groups/personalized/S/SEAAHHH-FOO-20160205/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG) to get our group rate and stay with us to enjoy the whole convention!

If you're interested in hosting an event in your room, please [email our hotel coordinator](mailto:hotel@foolscap.org) so we can make sure we get you set up in an appropriate room.

## Getting to Foolscap

### Light Rail / Bus
Want to take public transit to the convention? It's easy! Use [Metro Trip Planner](http://tripplanner.kingcounty.gov/) to find your route.

### Automobile
If you're coming by car, we're right off I-5. The hotel's site has [directions written by real humans](http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/washington/hilton-seattle-airport-and-conference-center-SEAAHHH/maps-directions/index.html), or you can [ask Google how to get there](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//Hilton+Seattle+Airport+%26+Conference+Center,+17620+International+Blvd,+Seattle,+WA+98188,+United+States/@47.4443862,-122.2953989,17z/data=!4m12!1m3!3m2!1s0x0000000000000000:0x7bc6c271ce8fe774!2sHilton+Seattle+Airport+%26+Conference+Center!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x54905cac0399ccbd:0x7bc6c271ce8fe774!2m2!1d-122.295713!2d47.444775). Either way, you can park on-site at a discounted $12/day rate. 

### Plane
Flying into Sea-Tac? We're a short walk across a skybridge from the airport parking structure, or you can take advantage of the hotel's complimentary airport shuttle.

### Personal Teleporter
Our designated arrival coordinates are:
[47°26'39.4" N<br>
122°17'42.1" W](https://www.google.com/maps/place/47%C2%B026%2739.4%22N+122%C2%B017%2742.1%22W/@47.44428,-122.29504,145m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0)

That puts you just outside the front door, so you can walk in and enjoy the convention!

## Weather in Seattle in February

The weather in the greater Seattle area in February tends to be cool and wet. Dress in layers and bring a water-repellant coat. A sweater or fleece jacket for cooler areas of the hotel is a good idea, too.
