For 15 years **Leonard Richardson** has been at the intersection of fantastic entertainment and computer programming. It started in 1998 when he created a script to automatically remix the surreal web comic “Pokey the Penguin.” He went on to create dozens of online art projects, the screen-scraping library Beautiful Soup, and two technical books on web APIs. His short story “Four Kinds of Cargo” is included in _The Year’s Best Science Fiction & Fantasy, 2013_ (Prime Books). Cory Doctorow calls Leonard’s novel _[Constellation Games](http://constellation.crummy.com/)_ (Candlemark & Gleam) “one of the smartest, most passionate, most principled science fiction novels I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading.”

**Brooks Peck** tells us he has difficulty focusing on his work and is often subject to distraction. A Clarion West graduate, he published stories in anthologies of the _Futuristic Cats!_ variety. He co-founded _Science Fiction Weekly_, the first professional sf review website, and later served as editor-in-chief. Recently he wrote two monster movies for the Syfy Channel. Today he is a curator at [EMP Museum](http://www.empmuseum.org/) in Seattle where recent exhibitions include _Icons of Science Fiction_, _Battlestar Galactica_, and _Avatar_.
