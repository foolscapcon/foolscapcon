Because we create our schedule at the convention each year, we can't tell you in advance what's going to happen! But that doesn't mean we can't tell you anything about it.

Take a look at past schedules to see what's happened before, and get an idea for the sorts of things we've done. If you're hoping to see something we haven't done before, _great!_ Come to Foolscap and propose it! If other people like it, then that means it's right for Foolscap.
