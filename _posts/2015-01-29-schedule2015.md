## Open Space Panel Descriptions

### Lawn Crayfish are Real (and other weird nature stuff)<a id="open1"></a>
What shows up in your neck of the woods that's neat, weird, and apparently never shows up in fiction? Geoducks? Lawn crayfish? Burrowing owls?

### Men, Women and Reading Fiction<a id="open2"></a>
Market research shows that men account for only 20% of the fiction read. Why? And what does this mean?

### The Rise of the Heroic Mad Scientist<a id="open3"></a>
We discuss the rise of the mad scientist from a stock villain to a protagonist.

### What Makes a Game Fun?<a id="open4"></a>
What are the good games, to you, and why? How can we find new, good, different games?

### Pitch your Fandom<a id="open5"></a>
"You NEED to get into thisâ€¦" Come tell everyone why your pet fandom is best fandom. In 90 seconds. Yes, there's a timer.

### First Contact<a id="open6"></a>
Create a world, and then create a race, and then a culture, that "thinks as well as man, but not like man"

### Fantasy Sports<a id="open7"></a>
No, not football! Quidditch, holodecks, zero-gravity- what fantasy sports would you like to see?

### Does Science Fiction NEED to be Predictive?<a id="open8"></a>
People often seem frightened away from writing / publishing Science Fiction because they feel they can't accurately predict the future. But is that REALLY what Science Fiction is about? Is that what SF classics were about?

### Ensemble Multiverses - The Drama of Strong Personalities<a id="open9"></a>
In this discussion, we will talk about teams in spec fiction, Avengers, Grant Morrison's Multiversity, Venture Bros, X-Men - how do a group of strong personalities compliment one another?

### Inclusivity in Fandom<a id="open10"></a>
Who does fandom include? Who do we exclude? Should we be more inclusive? If so, how? Who should be excluded?

### What Would You Recommend / Nominate?<a id="open11"></a>
What have you discovered recently that you want to share? Hugo nominations are open, too - what would you nominate?

### I Don't Hate This Female Character, But &hellip; <a id="open12"></a>
"I don't hate this female character; I only hate the lazy writing and shallow male-based wish fulfillment that went into her." If we actually get a female character, can we still have a constructive argument about how problematic she is? Or is that just sexist?

### Fandom Crafting!<a id="open13"></a>
4th Doctor scarves, D20 pillows, Perler sprites, and more! Fandom crafting seems to span all genres and media. What's your craft? Why'd you start? Why is crafting for your fandom important to you? Come chat with other crafters and non-crafters for inspiration and ideas.

###Why Not Just House Them All?<a id="open14"></a>
####Society's insistence that the disadvantaged prove themselves "deserving" of help
Getting help through official channels is a red tape nightmare, and there is massive resistance to solution that would simplify this. Why are we like this, and what can (or should) be done about it?

### Story Games: What Are They? Are They Games?<a id="open15"></a>
Story games straddle the line between improv and games. What are examples, how do they work, and are they games?

### Magic Cube Draft<a id="open16"></a>
Come draft from a pre-built assembly of cards specially designed for a fun, high-powered tour through Magic's history!

### Doctor Who: Classic or New and Does it Matter?<a id="open17"></a>
Many people only watch new Doctor Who, some classic only, while some watch both. Does it matter which?

### Revolution When?<a id="open18"></a>
Speculative Fiction has often had some kind of social change as part of the narrative (and has been explicitly used to think about new ways to organize society by some). Why haven't more of these ideas moved into "the real world"?

###Tea & Cookies Writing Slam (Round #2)<a id="open19"></a>
We choose genres and the Magic Writing Slam app generates two prompts for each writer. Write like crazy! Then share. 
**Bring Writing Equipment**

### Future Food<a id="open20"></a>
We discuss what we'll all be eating in the future, whether near or far.

### Sustaining a Group (especially D&D)<a id="open21"></a>
How do your get a group to survive? When people are moving in and out? Especially groups in transient environments: schools, university, people just moving?

### Apocalypse: Why?<a id="open22"></a>
"The end of the world" is a narrative far older than the speculative fiction genre as such. What might be behind the attraction? Are people destined to self-destruction, or is something else going on?

### Scratch My (Book) Itch <a id="open24"></a>
Do you have a story type? The kind of story that is up your alley, that pushes your buttons? What are some common ones (psychic kids, super-power school, werewolves in space)? Are some books a more easy access than others in the SF/F genre? Are there Level 100 books that anyone can read, 300 level books that only SF fans can appreciate, 500 level books only for experienced types? Let's make some recommendations and talk about who they're best for.

### Critical Response - a positive critique method<a id="open25"></a>
Learn how to give and receive critique on a work in progress - good for any media / art form. This method uses a format in which the artist can receive the feedback they want in a way that keeps personality conflicts, hatefulness and scapegoating OUT of the conversation

### PRETTY! &hellip; why?<a id="open26"></a>
Why do we think something is pretty? Culture? Genetics? Physics? The art, science, and/or religion of beauty. Let's discuss!

### Sustaining Foolscap<a id="open27"></a>
Foolscap is run by a small cadre of volunteers, and recent life events have made that number smaller. Come learn about where we're going, how to help, and why running Foolscap is fun.
